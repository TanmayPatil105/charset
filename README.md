# Charset

Charset is a fun data structure that is used to store characters and there frequencies. It was implemented in [Crosswords](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/libipuz/-/blob/master/libipuz/ipuz-charset.c?ref_type=heads) by Jonathan Blandford and Federico Mena.

This implementation from scratch is done for learning purposes.

## Todo
[ ] Migrate to cmake
[ ] Create a seperate test suite, implement all tests similar to [IPuzCharset](https://gitlab.gnome.org/jrb/libipuz/-/blob/master/libipuz/tests/charset.c?ref_type=heads) and make sure they all are passing
[ ] Implement TreeIterator (priority)
[ ] ...
